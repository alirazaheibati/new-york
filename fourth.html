                        from what appears to be the most distant single star ever seen.
                        Because light takes time to travel through space, scientists see this star as it appeared when its light began its journey 12.9 billion years ago â€” just 900 million years after the Big Bang that started the universe.

                    The find, described in the journal Nature, is unusual because most of the light that scientists have spotted from the early days of the universe has come from galaxies that contain many stars and look like little blobs.
                    "We're actually able to pick out the light from this one individual star," says Brian Welch, a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins University and the lead author

                    The newly discovered star supplants the previous record-holder for the most distant star ever observed. That one was spotted by Hubble in 2018, and its light had been traveling through space. Welch has nicknamed the star 'Earendel,'  Because light takes time to travel  galaxies that contain many stars.
