"Everybody loves him, [he] resonates with [everybody] in some way." The show is a wonderland of colorful sunsets, forests tucked into snowy.

                    The Joy of Painting is broadcast every day on some PBS stations across the country and is available on-demand to millions of viewers on Netflix and YouTube. There are Bob Ross bobbleheads, board games, underwear and coffee mugs. The Smithsonian's National Museum Of American History recently acquired four of his paintings for their permanent collection.

                    Ross — a throwback to the pre-Internet era — has a surprisingly huge following on Twitch, the streaming platform best known for video games, where fans can comment in real-time while he paints. Ross left behind thousands of paintings, which rarely go on display. So when the current solo exhibition opened at the Franklin Park Arts Center, fans flocked. There are Bob Ross bobbleheads, board

                    But this is no ordinary painting lesson: The students have come to Purcellville, Va., from as far away as Texas to learn to paint in the distinctive style and palette of Bob Ross, the Air Force sergeant-turned-painter who rose to public media fame in the 1980s and '90s with his TV show The Joy of Painting. Over 31 seasons and more than 400 episodes, Ross became known for his hushed,

                    "It's almost spiritual," Cliff Nolan, a painter from nearby Manassas, Va., says about being in the class at the Franklin Park Arts Center. In a room lined with 24 original Ross paintings, Nolan pulls a laminated photo book out of his pocket. It's filled with pictures of paintings inspired by Ross' work, using the wet-on-wet painting technique he used. "Bob is just wonderful," Nolan says with a

                    Thousands of people have visited the show since it opened last month. Bracey says she's expecting at least 15,000 by the time the exhibition closes on Oct. 15. That's half the number of visitors the art center usually sees in an entire year. It's become a kind of unexpected pilgrimage for fans, from all over.
